# Harnessing NOAA Data for Advanced Hail Detection: A Technical Exploration

In meteorological data analysis, accurately detecting and analyzing hail events is crucial. Leveraging data from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) offers invaluable information. I implemented several hail detection algorithms: HDR, HSDA, HSDA_MF, and MEHS. Explore these in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/amultani1234/hailtrace/tree/main/processing/algorithms).

## Streaming Data from NOAA

NOAA provides comprehensive datasets crucial for meteorological research. Streaming this data involves accessing their APIs, forming the backbone of our hail detection work.

## Implementing Hail Detection Algorithms

### HDR (Hail Detection Ratio)
This algorithm identifies hail by analyzing radar reflectivity patterns in NOAA's radar data.

### HSDA (Hail Size Discrimination Algorithm)
HSDA detects hail and estimates its size, essential for assessing hailstorm impacts.

### HSDA_MF (Hail Size Discrimination Algorithm - Multi-Factor)
An extension of HSDA, it incorporates additional variables like wind and temperature, enhancing size estimation accuracy.

### MEHS (Maximum Expected Hail Size)
MEHS predicts the maximum hail size, crucial for timely warnings and risk mitigation.

## Conclusion

By applying these algorithms to NOAA's data, we accurately detect hail events and understand their potential impact. For more details and code implementation, visit my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/amultani1234/hailtrace/tree/main/processing/algorithms).
